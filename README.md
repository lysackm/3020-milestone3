### running this project

In a terminal (in VScode go to the top terminal menu and click "new terminal") use the command `cd ./milestone3` and then `npm start`. This will spin up a local version of 
the project on probably http://localhost:3000. This is a link to a local port on your computer 3000. Take comp 3010 to learn more.

Everytime you you change the packages in package.json you will need to run `npm install` or `yarn install`. This is downloading node modules.
